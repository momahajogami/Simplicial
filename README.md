What's simpler or nicer than the definition of a category?

Categories were defined in order to define Functors in order to define natural transformations. 

Historically, the natural transformation in mind was the natural transformaiton from singular homology to simplicial homology. 

The relevance of this historical fact to you, the math-going individual, is that these two functors which can transform, one into the other so naturally, seem to represent intuition and calculation respectively. 

With this belief in mind, I initialize a repository in full confidence that within some weeks or months, I'll have for you here, by my own work and others', a collection of writing in Haskell, Python, Ruby and whatever else you like so that you can simply carry on in the language of your choice thinking about the objects from mathematics which are the essence of intuition.
